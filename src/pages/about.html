            <h2>Why "Le Chat Luthier"?</h2>
            <p>
                The name "Le Chat Luthier" translates to "The Luthier Cat" in French. A luthier is a craftsman who builds or repairs string instruments. Our platform aims to be the artisan of audio experiences, crafting the perfect soundscape for your adventures, much like a luthier crafts instruments. And who doesn't love cats?
